# Golf Club Tournament and Membership API

## Overview
This project provides a RESTful API for managing golf club tournaments and memberships. It allows users to add new members, create tournaments, and associate members with tournaments. Additionally, you can search for members and tournaments based on various attributes

The project is built with Spring Boot, JPA, and uses MySQL as the database. It also supports Docker for easy setup and deployment.

Some things were not finished, including docker and mysql setup, for some reason i kept getting an error im unfamiliar with and couldnt get them linked together, most code should be correct but couldnt figure this step out :(
